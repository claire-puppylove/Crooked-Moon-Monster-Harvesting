# Crooked-Moon-Monster-Harvesting

Monster Harvesting options I added for my Crooked Moon campaign

## Objective

Following the publication of [The Crooked Moon](crookedmoon.com) I decided to DM it for my friends.

Now in most video games I enjoy monster drops, monster harvesting, or otherwise having an item be part of the story-telling of the world the players are in. I take great inspiration from games like Dark Souls, where item descriptions are how we find out some of the lore of the monsters we just defeated, as well as Tears of the Kingdom, where you can do wacky things with items recovered from monster parts.
