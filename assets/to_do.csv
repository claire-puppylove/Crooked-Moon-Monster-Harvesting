Primordial Necrolisk Spiritbane,-,-,Weapon (Legendary)(Requires Attunement),-,-,-,"The Primordial Necrolisk is the queen of Necrolisks, underground creatures that feeds on the essence of spirits, and this magical hunger is still present on its awe-inducing gigantic teeth. You used this powerful material to make a primordial necrotic dragon tooth weapon that is the bane of spirits. The weapon ignores any sort of resistance or immunity to Piercing, Slashing, or Bludgeoning damage caused by the enemy being incorporeal. Depending on what weapon you made, it makes that type of damage. In addition, it deals +2d10 Force damage on any hit, or +6d10 Force damage against incorporeal enemies. When you roll a 20 on a d20 to attack an incorporeal creature, it dies. Whenever you kill any creature with it you regain the damage you dealt on the killing attack to your Hit Points. The weapon has 5 charges. As a Magic action, you can expend one charge to call to the hunger of the weapon to pull spirits or otherwise incorporeal enemies that are in a 40 ft radius from you, when doing so, they immediately get pulled 10 ft toward you. As part of the same action, any incorporeal enemies that are within 20 ft of you must succeed on a DC 20 Strength Saving Throw or take 11d10 Force damage. You can also spend one charge to sense the presence of spirits or incorporeal creatures in a 1,000 ft radius. The weapon regains 1d6 charges when you take a Long Rest.",-,-,-,-
